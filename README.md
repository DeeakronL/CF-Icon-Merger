# CF-Icon-Merger
Program to help put together unit thumbnail pictures for a wiki

The CF-Icon-Merger.py file is a more specific version of the program while the ImageMerger.py file is more general and configurable (using IMConfig.py).

This program relies upon the Pillow (PIL) library for Python.

To use the program, you need 3 files: a basic unit image, a background to use, and a border or some UI element to go in front.
